# Roman Numerals Kata 

Using Test Driven Development to solve Roman Numerals Kata

# Defining the problem

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters: 

- **I** meaning **1**,
- **V** meaning **5**, 
- **X** meaning **10**,
- **L** meaning **50**,
- **C** meaning **100**.

We would like to be able to convert numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents.   

# Defining the tools

### Test Driven Development

The rules of TDD:

1. Write a failing test.
2. Write the simplest bit of code that makes it pass.
3. Refactor the code to follow the rules of simple design.

This is also called the **Red-Green-Refactor cycle of TDD**.

> The key concept is to write your **unit test before** you write a line of implementation **code**.

### Ping pong programming

1. Person A writes a new test and sees that it fails.
2. Person B implements the code needed to pass the test.
3. Person B writes the next test and sees that it fails.
4. Person A implements the code needed to pass the test.

And so on. Refactoring is done whenever the need arises by whoever is driving.

# Let’s get started!
